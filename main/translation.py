    For each of the input Chinese words, please output the following as a one row in a table.  There should be the following columns in table related to the word.  

    Generate output similar to the following example: 
    1. Word:  农场 (If the word provided is in traditional Chinese, then replace it with the simplified version)
    2. Pinyin:  nóng chǎng  (This is a column of proper pinyin.  All the tones should be shown explicitly, no number representation for tone allowed in this column) 
    3. Pinyin Simplified:  nong2 chang3  (Instead of showing tones explicitly use number to represent tones instead and use v to represent the special character ǜ)    
    4. Type:   Noun (This should be adjusted whether the meaning of the word is noun/adjective/verb based on the meaning and example sentence)
    5. Word Category: Agriculture (This should be a general category that the word belongs to)
    5. Meaning:  Farm (This is could be a longer description of the meaning of the word if no exact translation exists in English.  If this is a common word in English, then only one word translation is sufficient)
    6. Sentence:  我暑假打算去爷爷的农场帮忙  
    7. Sentence Pinyin:  Wǒ shǔjià dǎsuàn qù yéye de nóngchǎng bāngmáng. 
    8. Sentence Meaning:  I plan to go to my grandfather's farm to help during the summer vacation.

    For each word with multiple meanings, add more rows to the the table with alternate meaning and example sentence.  Each row should have a unique meaning.
    If there is only one meaning, then keep only one row for each word.  Do not add rows for alternate meanings if there is only one meaning.  If the two meanings are sufficiently similar then they can be included in the same row.
    If the meanings are different, then the second meaning should be in a new row with the same word, pinyin, word type, and sentence.  Don't omit any values in any row even if they are the same as the row above.

    Translation Instructions:
    When provided with words that have nuances such that the English translation is not sufficient to capture the full meaning of the word, please provide a more nuanced translation.  
    Do NOT provide incomplete one word translations for words that have nuanced meanings.  
    Example words with nuanced translations:

    Word: 包容
    Incomplete Literal Translation: Tolerance --> (Incorrect)
    Nuanced Translation: To accept differences with understanding, not just putting up with them. --> (Correct)

    Word: 敬畏 (jìngwèi)

    Word: 时光 (shíguāng)
    Incomplete Literal Translation: Time --> (Incorrect)
    Correct Nuanced Translation: A period or moment in time; often used poetically to refer to the passage of time. --> (Correct)

    Conversely, if a word has a simple translation that is sufficient to capture the meaning, then only provide the simple translation.  
    Do not provide a nuanced translation if the simple translation is sufficient.  
    In this case, do not nuance along the simple translation.  Only provide the simple translation.
    Example words with simple translations:
    Word: 爱 (ài)
    Literal Translation: Love --> (Correct)
    Explained Translation:  Love; An intense feeling of deep affection.--> (Incorrect)
